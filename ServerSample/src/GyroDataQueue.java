// This class keeps the queue with data.
// The data can be pushed by main thread, when gyroscope or accelerometer sensor were changed.
// The data can be extracted by ServerSocket (some other thread) to pass them to the client 
// (via TCP/IP connection).
// As the data are extracted and are pushed from different threads the synchronization is used.
// We synchronize both methods (Poll and Offer) and queue with data (usage of BlockingQueue)
